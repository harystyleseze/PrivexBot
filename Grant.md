### **PrivexBot: AI Chatbot Platform**

**Tagline:**

Private AI Chatbots Tailored for Your Business – Available 24/7 for Customer Assistance

---

### **Project Description**

We intend to build PrivexBot, a privacy-first low code AI chatbot, on the Secret Network’s cutting-edge technology, Secret AI. Leveraging the power of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), it ensures that all data is processed securely and privately. PrivexBot enables businesses to create fully-customizable chatbots for various functions like customer support, sales assistance, and personal assistant roles. PrivexBot integrates three core components: privacy (Priv) through a privacy-first design, secure execution (Ex) via Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on Secret Network, and AI chatbot capabilities (Bot).

With integration into popular platforms like WordPress, Wix, Shopify, and messaging tools such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Slack, PrivexBot is designed to be highly accessible. It also supports data import from multiple sources like websites, PDFs, DOCX files, YouTube videos, and Google Sheets, allowing businesses to easily train their bots. Through a user-friendly interface, businesses can customize and deploy their bots without needing any coding skills.

The platform will also integrate secret smart contracts for tracking usage and payments via Secret coin and SNIP-20 tokens, combining the power of AI with decentralized privacy and monetization.

### **Problem / Solution**

**Problem:**  
Many businesses today struggle with delivering timely and efficient customer support. Traditional systems are either costly or fail to protect sensitive customer data. Additionally, there’s a growing need for scalable, 24/7 support channels that don’t compromise privacy.

**Solution:**  
PrivexBot solves this problem by offering businesses a customizable, privacy-first AI chatbot platform. The use of Secret Network’s confidential computing ensures that all data remains private and secure while providing scalable, 24/7 automation for customer support, sales, and internal operations. By integrating AI with blockchain, we also enable businesses to automate payments via SCRT and SNIP-20 tokens or track usage via smart contract on secret network.

### **Detailed Product Description**

PrivexBot will allow businesses to create tailored AI chatbots in three simple steps:

1. **Import Data**: Businesses upload content (website links, PDFs, DOCX, YouTube videos, etc.) that PrivexBot’s AI uses to train the chatbot.
2. **Customize Your Bot**: Users can personalize the bot’s appearance and responses to align with their branding.
3. **Deploy Your Bot**: No coding required—users simply copy-paste a line of code or share a link to deploy their bot.

PrivexBot will support integration with platforms like WordPress, Wix, Shopify, Slack, WhatsApp, Instagram, and more. The platform ensures end-to-end security using TEE technology for data privacy. In addition, it includes Zapier integration for automating workflows like CRM updates, form submissions, and appointment bookings.

**Key Features:**

- **Privacy by Design**: Using Secret AI Decentralized Confidential Computing solution to ensure data security.
- **AI Integration**: Allows businesses to train and deploy bots using various content sources.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Integrates seamlessly with websites, messaging apps, and more.
- **Monetization**: Enables businesses to monetize chatbot interactions through SCRT/SNIP-20 tokens and track usage via smart contracts on secret network.

### **Go-to-Market Plan**

We plan to launch PrivexBot through a two-pronged approach:

1. **Targeting Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs)**: We’ll focus on SMEs looking for cost-effective and scalable solutions to automate customer service, sales, and employee training. These businesses will be encouraged to sign up through our free plan and easily scale with premium plans as needed.
2. **Targeting Larger Enterprises**: For larger organizations, we’ll offer custom enterprise solutions that integrate with their existing infrastructure and provide dedicated support.

We will promote PrivexBot through targeted social media ads, partnerships with platforms like Shopify and WordPress, and content marketing. Additionally, we’ll leverage existing customer success stories to build trust and credibility in the market.

### **Value Capture for Secret Network Ecosystem**

PrivexBot will bring a substantial value to the Secret Network ecosystem by introducing a highly usable and valuable privacy-first application. By integrating decentralized payments through SNIP-20 tokens and using Secret AI Decentralized Confidential Computing solution for privacy, we will:

1. **Increase TVL (Total Value Locked)** by encouraging businesses to stake tokens for bot usage.
2. **Increase User Adoption**: Offering affordable plans for smaller businesses will drive adoption.
3. **Encourage Developer Engagement**: The open-source nature of PrivexBot will attract developers to contribute to its growth, helping foster further innovation on Secret Network.
