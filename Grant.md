### **Project Description**

PrivexBot is a privacy-first AI chatbot platform built on the Secret Network’s cutting-edge technology. Leveraging the power of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), it ensures that all data is processed securely and privately. PrivexBot enables businesses to create fully-customizable chatbots for various functions like customer support, sales assistance, and personal assistant roles.

With integration into popular platforms like WordPress, Wix, Shopify, and messaging tools such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Slack, PrivexBot is designed to be highly accessible. It also supports data import from multiple sources like websites, PDFs, DOCX files, YouTube videos, and Google Sheets, allowing businesses to easily train their bots. Through a user-friendly interface, businesses can deploy their bots without needing any coding skills.

The platform also integrates decentralized privacy with SNIP-20 token-based smart contracts to track usage and payments, making it a unique blend of AI, privacy, and blockchain.

### **Problem / Solution**

**Problem:**  
Many businesses today struggle with delivering timely and efficient customer support. Traditional systems are either costly or fail to protect sensitive customer data. Additionally, there’s a growing need for scalable, 24/7 support channels that don’t compromise privacy.

**Solution:**  
PrivexBot solves this problem by offering businesses a customizable, privacy-first AI chatbot platform. The use of Secret Network’s confidential computing ensures that all data remains private and secure while providing scalable, 24/7 automation for customer support, sales, and internal operations. By integrating AI with blockchain, we also enable businesses to automate payments and track usage via SNIP-20 tokens.

PrivexBot supports integration with platforms like WordPress, Wix, Shopify, Slack, WhatsApp, Instagram, and more. The platform ensures end-to-end security using TEE technology for data privacy. In addition, it includes Zapier integration for automating workflows like CRM updates, form submissions, and appointment bookings.
