### **Project Name**

**PrivexBot: AI Chatbot Builder**

---
### **Project Description**

PrivexBot is a privacy-first, no-code AI chatbot builder that enables businesses to deploy custom chatbots trained on their own data — all while maintaining strict data confidentiality using Secret AI's **Decentralized Confidential Computing** solution with **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)** capabilities. With PrivexBot, users can import data from websites, PDFs, DOCX files, YouTube videos, and spreadsheets, then deploy bots across websites, WhatsApp, Instagram, Discord, and Slack — in minutes.

PrivexBot is designed around three core principles:
- **Privacy (Priv)** — Confidential computing powered by Secret AI
- **Execution (Ex)** — Efficient secure AI processing enabled by the TEE
- **Bot** — representing the AI chatbot functionality for businesses

PrivexBot will also integrate Secret smart contracts to manage SNIP-20-based subscriptions and track usage with privacy guarantees — combining the benefits of decentralized infrastructure with AI automation.

### **Problem / Solution**  

**Problem**:  
Many businesses today struggle with delivering timely and efficient customer support. Traditional systems are either costly or fail to protect sensitive customer data. Additionally, there’s a growing need for scalable, 24/7 support channels that don’t compromise privacy.


**Solution**:  
PrivexBot solves this problem by offering businesses a customizable, privacy-first AI chatbot platform. The use of Secret Network’s AI confidential computing solution ensures that all data remains private and secure while providing scalable, 24/7 automation for customer support, sales, and internal operations. By integrating AI with blockchain, we also enable businesses to automate payments via SCRT and SNIP-20 tokens or track usage via smart contract on secret network.

### **Detailed Product Description**

PrivexBot will allow businesses to create tailored AI chatbots in three simple steps:

1. **Import Data**: Businesses upload content (website links, PDFs, DOCX, YouTube videos, etc.) that PrivexBot’s AI uses to train the chatbot.
2. **Customize Your Bot**: Users can personalize the bot’s appearance and responses to align with their branding. Such as the name, logo, voice, and tone with a live editor.
3. **Deploy Your Bot**: Deploy to websites, social media, or messaging platforms in minutes. No coding required—users simply copy-paste a line of code or share a link to deploy their bot.

PrivexBot will support integration with platforms like WordPress, Wix, Shopify, Slack, WhatsApp, Instagram, and more. The platform ensures end-to-end security using TEE technology for data privacy. In addition, it includes Zapier integration for automating workflows like CRM updates, form submissions, and appointment bookings.

**Key Features:**

- **Privacy by Design**: Using Secret AI Decentralized Confidential Computing solution to ensure data security.
- **AI Integration**: Allows businesses to train and deploy bots using various content sources.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Integrates seamlessly with websites, messaging apps, Zapier, Discord, Slack, and Shopify.
- **Integrated Dashboard**: Monitor bot performance and usage via an integrated dashboard.
- **Monetization**: Enables businesses to monetize chatbot interactions through SCRT/SNIP-20 tokens and track usage via smart contracts on secret network.

**Security Features:**

- **Confidential data training and inference**
- **Zero data leakage architecture**
- **On-chain usage tracking without revealing usage metadata**

**Innovation**:  
PrivexBot is one of the first decentralized AI chatbot builders where **no user data is ever exposed**. This makes it especially attractive to privacy-conscious industries like healthcare, education, and finance.

### **Go-to-Market Plan**

We plan to launch PrivexBot through a two-pronged approach:

1. **Targeting Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs)**: We’ll focus on SMEs looking for cost-effective and scalable solutions to automate customer service, sales, and employee training. These businesses will be encouraged to sign up through our free plan and easily scale with premium plans as needed.
2. **Targeting Larger Enterprises**: For larger organizations, we’ll offer custom enterprise solutions that integrate with their existing infrastructure and provide dedicated support.

We will promote PrivexBot through targeted social media ads, partnerships with platforms like Shopify and WordPress, and content marketing. Additionally, we’ll leverage existing customer success stories to build trust and credibility in the market.

Our growth strategy includes:

- Shopify/WordPress plugin marketplace listings
- Content marketing targeting non-technical founders
- Outreach in privacy-first and Web3 communities
- Early user incentives (free tiers, bonus features for staking SCRT)

### **Value Capture for Secret Network Ecosystem**

PrivexBot will bring a substantial value to the Secret Network ecosystem by introducing a highly usable and valuable privacy-first application. By integrating decentralized payments through SNIP-20 tokens and using Secret AI Decentralized Confidential Computing solution for privacy, we will:

1. **Increase TVL (Total Value Locked)** by encouraging businesses to stake tokens for bot usage, enabling staked SCRT or SNIP-20 tokens for usage-based billing.
2. **Increase User Adoption**: of SCRT/SNIP-20 tokens, offering affordable plans for smaller businesses will drive adoption.
3. **Increased transactions**: every bot interaction and payment will generate on-chain usage
4. **Expanding use cases** for Secret AI and SNIP-20 contracts, especially for web3 startups needing privacy-centric AI assistants for DeFi, DAOs, and NFT projects.
5. **Attracting new developers and businesses** into the secret ecosystem. The open-source nature of PrivexBot will attract developers to contribute to its growth, helping foster further innovation on Secret Network.
