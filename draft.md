# PrivexBot Team

## Project Description
This is an **application** for the grant program: **Secret Network Grant Program: Privacy-as-a-Service**

We are building **PrivexBot**, a privacy-first, no-code AI chatbot builder designed to empower businesses to deploy secure, intelligent chatbots trained on proprietary data. The chatbots will run on **Secret AI**, utilizing **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** to guarantee confidential processing of sensitive business and user data.

PrivexBot will integrate Secret smart contracts to manage **usage tracking and token-based payments** via **SCRT and SNIP-20 tokens**, combining AI automation with decentralized monetization and privacy. This allows for chatbot data ingestion, user queries, and payment logic to be executed privately on-chain.

Our goal is to make privacy-preserving AI accessible to SMEs and enterprises, providing the flexibility of AI assistants without the risks of centralized data storage.

## Problem / Solution
**Problem**:  
Current AI chatbot platforms require businesses to upload data to centralized servers, exposing customer interactions, business knowledge, and analytics to potential leaks and breaches. This model lacks transparency, auditability, and compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR.

**Solution**:  
PrivexBot enables businesses to train and operate AI chatbots in a **confidential, decentralized environment** using Secret Network’s Privacy-as-a-Service stack. All chatbot data processing and usage metering is done within **Secret’s TEEs**, with billing and monetization handled via on-chain SNIP-20 smart contracts. This ensures full privacy, security, and trust in the chatbot logic and interactions—an ideal solution for businesses in finance, healthcare, education, and e-commerce.

## Detailed Product Description
PrivexBot is a full-stack Privacy-as-a-Service platform that allows businesses to deploy AI chatbots in three steps:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Businesses can upload websites, PDFs, DOCX, Google Sheets, or YouTube transcripts to train chatbots.
2. **Bot Customization**: A React-based frontend lets users visually modify the chatbot’s behavior, tone, and branding.
3. **Deployment**: Bots can be embedded via iframe or linked directly on platforms like WordPress, Wix, Shopify, Slack, WhatsApp, and Instagram.

### Key Technical Features:
- **AI Layer**: Confidential LLM interactions running inside Secret’s TEEs.
- **Smart Contracts**: SNIP-20 smart contracts handle usage tracking and token-based billing.
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Built using React, enabling visual bot building and performance analytics.
- **Zapier Integration**: Automate workflows such as CRM updates, ticket logging, or form handling via private triggers.

PrivexBot’s core backend functions (data training, query resolution, and metrics logging) are all executed inside a **decentralized confidential compute environment**, giving users complete control and privacy over their data.

## Go-to-Market Plan
PrivexBot will follow a two-tiered go-to-market approach:

1. **SME Outreach**: Focused on small and mid-sized businesses needing low-cost automation. We’ll use targeted content marketing, SEO, and integrations with Web2 platforms (WordPress, Wix) to reach this audience.
2. **Enterprise Sales**: For larger organizations needing privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), we’ll offer a tailored onboarding experience with feature add-ons and SLAs.

We’ll launch a **free tier** with limited monthly queries to onboard users quickly and convert them to paid plans via SNIP-20 tokens or fiat. We’ll also incentivize adoption via referral bonuses and Secret-based affiliate programs.

## Value Capture for Secret Network Ecosystem
PrivexBot will contribute to Secret Network growth in multiple ways:

- **TVL Growth**: Businesses will lock/stake SNIP-20 tokens to pay for AI usage.
- **Transaction Volume**: Chatbot interactions and token usage will drive steady on-chain traffic.
- **User Adoption**: Web2 businesses adopting AI tools will onboard to Secret Network through PrivexBot.
- **Developer Ecosystem**: Open-source plugin system will invite third-party devs to build extensions for PrivexBot on Secret.

This grant will fund foundational features needed to validate the product-market fit of Privacy-as-a-Service use cases on Secret.
