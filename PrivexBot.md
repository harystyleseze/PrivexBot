## ðŸ’¼ Secret Grants Application: **PrivexBot**

---

### **Project Name**
**PrivexBot: AI Chatbot Platform**

---

### **Project Description**

PrivexBot is a privacy-first, no-code AI chatbot builder that enables businesses to deploy custom chatbots trained on their own data â€” all while maintaining strict data confidentiality using **Secret Networkâ€™s Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** and **Secret AI**. With PrivexBot, users can import data from websites, PDFs, DOCX files, YouTube videos, and spreadsheets, then deploy bots across websites, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Slack â€” in minutes.

PrivexBot is designed around three core principles:
- **Privacy (Priv)** â€” Confidential computing powered by Secret Network
- **Execution (Ex)** â€” Efficient secure AI processing
- **Bot** â€” Custom AI chat assistants for businesses

PrivexBot will also integrate Secret smart contracts to manage SNIP-20-based subscriptions and track usage with privacy guarantees â€” fusing the benefits of decentralized infrastructure with AI automation.

---

### **Problem / Solution**  

**Problem**:  
Businesses increasingly rely on AI assistants but face two key challenges: (1) existing tools risk exposing customer data, and (2) they often lack the ability to monetize or manage usage transparently and securely.

**Solution**:  
PrivexBot solves these challenges by combining AI with Secret Networkâ€™s decentralized privacy infrastructure. It allows businesses to build AI assistants that **train on private data securely**, **run on a privacy-first decentralized network**, and **handle usage/payment through SNIP-20 smart contracts** â€” all through a low-code platform.

### **Detailed Product Description**

**Core User Flow:**

1. **Import Content**: Upload business documents, websites, or videos to train the AI chatbot.
2. **Customize UI/UX**: Customize the chatbot look, voice, and tone with a live editor.
3. **Deploy**: Deploy to websites, social media, or messaging platforms in minutes â€” no coding needed.

**Technical Architecture:**

- **Backend AI Layer**: Processes private training data inside Secretâ€™s TEE enclave using Secret AI.
- **Smart Contracts**: Manage SNIP-20 token-based subscriptions and enforce usage quotas on-chain.
- **Frontend Platform**: Enables data upload, bot training, customization, and cross-channel deployment.
- **Integration Layer**: Includes Zapier support and SDKs for platforms like WordPress, Shopify, and Slack.

**Security Features:**

- **Confidential data training and inference**
- **Zero data leakage architecture**
- **On-chain usage tracking without revealing usage metadata**

**Innovation**:  
PrivexBot is one of the first decentralized AI chatbot builders where **no user data is ever exposed**. This makes it especially attractive to privacy-conscious industries like healthcare, education, and finance.
